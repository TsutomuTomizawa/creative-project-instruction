# Benefit-Focused Body Copy Framework

## The Benefit-Driven Writing System

### Core Principle
**Benefits = What the feature does for the user**
**Features = What the product has**

**Example:**
- Feature: "256-bit SSL encryption"
- Benefit: "Your data stays completely private and secure"

### The WIFM (What's In It For Me) Test
Every sentence should pass the WIFM test:
- Does this tell the user what they gain?
- Does this solve a problem they have?
- Does this help them achieve their goals?

## Benefit Identification Framework

### Step 1: List All Features
Create comprehensive feature inventory:
- Core functionality
- Technical specifications
- Available integrations
- Support options
- Pricing structure

### Step 2: Transform Features to Benefits
Use the "Which means..." bridge:
- Feature: Real-time collaboration
- Which means: Your team can work together instantly, no matter where they are
- Benefit: Never miss a deadline due to communication delays

### Step 3: Prioritize Benefits by Impact
Rank benefits by:
1. **Primary Benefits:** Core value proposition
2. **Secondary Benefits:** Supporting advantages
3. **Tertiary Benefits:** Nice-to-have features
