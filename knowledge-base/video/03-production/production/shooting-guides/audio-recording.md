# Audio Recording Best Practices

## Audio Fundamentals

### Why Audio Matters
- **Audience Tolerance:** People will watch poor video but not poor audio
- **Professionalism:** Good audio immediately elevates content quality
- **Engagement:** Clear audio keeps viewers engaged longer
- **Comprehension:** Essential for educational and instructional content

### Audio Basics
- **Sample Rate:** 48kHz for video (24kHz for web)
- **Bit Depth:** 24-bit for recording, 16-bit for final output
- **Dynamic Range:** Difference between loudest and softest sounds
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** Clean signal vs. background noise

## Microphone Types and Selection

### Lavalier (Lapel) Microphones
- **Best For:** Interviews, presentations, hands-free recording
- **Pros:** Discreet, consistent distance from mouth
- **Cons:** Can pick up clothing rustle, limited mobility
- **Recommended:** Rode Wireless GO, Shure MVL

### Shotgun Microphones
- **Best For:** Boom operation, directional recording
- **Pros:** Highly directional, excellent for controlled environments
- **Cons:** Requires operator, visible in frame if not careful
- **Recommended:** Rode VideoMic Pro, Deity V-Mic D3

### Handheld Microphones
- **Best For:** Interviews, presentations, dynamic situations
- **Pros:** Familiar to subjects, good control
- **Cons:** Visible in frame, requires holding
- **Recommended:** Shure SM58, Rode Reporter

### USB/Desktop Microphones
- **Best For:** Streaming, voiceovers, controlled environments
- **Pros:** Easy setup, good quality, no additional equipment
- **Cons:** Limited mobility, not portable
- **Recommended:** Blue Yeti, Rode PodMic

## Recording Setup Guidelines

### Studio/Controlled Environment
```
Setup:
- Primary mic: Large diaphragm condenser or dynamic
- Position: 6-8 inches from subject
- Angle: Slightly off-axis to avoid plosives
- Backup: Lavalier mic as safety
- Monitoring: Headphones for real-time check

Room Treatment:
- Acoustic panels or blankets
- Carpet or rugs to reduce reflections
- Minimize hard surfaces
- Control room tone/ambient noise
```

### Field Recording/Interviews
```
Setup:
- Primary mic: Shotgun on boom pole
- Position: 12-18 inches from subject, just out of frame
- Backup: Lavalier mic on subject
- Wind protection: Windscreen and dead cat
- Monitoring: Headphones with mixer

Environment:
- Scout location for noise issues
- Use directional mics to isolate subject
- Position away from traffic/noise sources
- Have backup locations ready
```

### Live Streaming/Webinars
```
Setup:
- Primary mic: USB condenser or dynamic
- Position: 6-8 inches from mouth
- Backup: Built-in or secondary USB mic
- Processing: Real-time noise reduction
- Monitoring: Headphones for feedback prevention

Software:
- Use OBS or similar for advanced audio processing
- Apply noise gate and compressor
- Monitor levels continuously
- Test setup before going live
```

## Audio Recording Levels

### Optimal Recording Levels
- **Peak Levels:** Never exceed -6dB
- **Average Levels:** Aim for -18dB to -12dB
- **Dialogue:** Consistent levels around -12dB
- **Music:** Can peak higher but watch for clipping

### Monitoring Tools
- **VU Meters:** Show average levels
- **Peak Meters:** Show instantaneous peaks
- **Loudness Meters:** LUFS for broadcast standards
- **Spectrum Analyzers:** Frequency content analysis

## Common Audio Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Background Noise
- **Solution:** Use noise gate, directional mics, acoustic treatment
- **Prevention:** Scout locations, use proper mic technique

### Problem: Echo/Reverb
- **Solution:** Add acoustic treatment, get closer to subject
- **Prevention:** Avoid hard surfaces, use deadening materials

### Problem: Inconsistent Levels
- **Solution:** Use compressor, maintain consistent mic distance
- **Prevention:** Proper gain staging, monitor levels continuously

### Problem: Plosives (P-sounds)
- **Solution:** Use pop filter, position mic off-axis
- **Prevention:** Proper mic technique, windscreen usage

### Problem: Handling Noise
- **Solution:** Use shock mount, train subjects on mic handling
- **Prevention:** Proper equipment setup, subject briefing

## Recording Techniques

### Single Subject Recording
- **Mic Placement:** 6-8 inches from mouth
- **Angle:** Slightly off-axis to avoid breathing
- **Backup:** Always record backup track
- **Monitoring:** Continuous level monitoring

### Multi-Subject Recording
- **Individual Mics:** Each subject gets own microphone
- **Mixing:** Balance levels during recording
- **Isolation:** Minimize crosstalk between mics
- **Sync:** Ensure all mics are properly synced

### Interview Recording
- **Host Mic:** Consistent setup throughout
- **Guest Mic:** Adjusted for each guest
- **Room Tone:** Record 30 seconds of ambient sound
- **Backup:** Multiple recording methods

## Post-Production Audio Processing

### Essential Processing Chain
1. **Noise Reduction:** Remove background noise
2. **EQ:** Enhance voice frequencies, reduce problem areas
3. **Compression:** Even out dynamic range
4. **Normalization:** Consistent output levels
5. **Limiting:** Prevent clipping in final output

### EQ Guidelines for Voice
- **High-Pass Filter:** Remove below 80Hz
- **Presence Boost:** Slight boost around 3-5kHz
- **Sibilance Control:** Reduce harsh frequencies around 6-8kHz
- **Warmth:** Subtle boost around 200-400Hz if needed

### Compression Settings
- **Ratio:** 3:1 to 4:1 for voice
- **Attack:** Fast enough to catch transients
- **Release:** Natural-sounding decay
- **Threshold:** Set to engage on loud passages

## Platform-Specific Audio Requirements

### YouTube
- **Loudness:** -14 LUFS integrated
- **Peak Levels:** -1dB maximum
- **Format:** 48kHz, 16-bit minimum
- **Channels:** Stereo preferred

### Podcast Platforms
