# Video Lighting Setup Guide

## Basic Lighting Principles

### Key Lighting Concepts
- **Key Light:** Primary light source, creates main illumination
- **Fill Light:** Secondary light, reduces shadows
- **Back Light:** Separates subject from background
- **Ambient Light:** Overall environmental lighting

### Light Quality
- **Hard Light:** Direct, creates sharp shadows (focused/dramatic)
- **Soft Light:** Diffused, creates gentle shadows (flattering/natural)
- **Color Temperature:** Warm (3200K) vs. Cool (5600K) light

## Three-Point Lighting Setup

### Standard Configuration
```
    [Back Light]
         |
         |
    [Subject]
       / \
      /   \
[Key Light] [Fill Light]
```

### Key Light Placement
- **Position:** 45° angle from subject
- **Height:** Slightly above eye level
- **Distance:** 3-6 feet from subject
- **Power:** Strongest light source (100%)

### Fill Light Placement
- **Position:** Opposite side of key light
- **Height:** Same as key light
- **Distance:** Further than key light
- **Power:** 50-75% of key light intensity

### Back Light Placement
- **Position:** Behind subject, opposite camera
- **Height:** Above subject's head
- **Distance:** 4-8 feet behind subject
- **Power:** 25-50% of key light intensity

- **Prevention:** Use butterfly lighting pattern

### Problem: Background Too Dark
- **Solution:** Add dedicated background lighting
- **Prevention:** Plan lighting setup for entire scene

### Problem: Color Temperature Mismatch
- **Solution:** Use color correction gels or adjust camera white balance
- **Prevention:** Use consistent light sources

### Problem: Flickering Lights
- **Solution:** Check power supply and cable connections
- **Prevention:** Use quality equipment and stable power

## Platform-Specific Considerations
